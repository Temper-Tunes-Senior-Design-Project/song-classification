# song-classification

This is involved in pre classifying songs.

First, the songs will be classied to a particular mood

From there, the songs will be dimensionalized within each cluster and then the users songs that match that mood cluster will then also be dimensionalized.

After finding the cetriod between the users songs within that genre, the closest new songs to that centriod will also be added to the playlist.

For further personaliztion, some options could include: 

- Only picking such songs that are closest to commonly listened genres

- avoiding explicit songs
